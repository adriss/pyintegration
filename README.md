# PyIntegration
PyIntegration is an enterprise integration framework that provides an out-of-the-box solution for the patterns in the now-classic Enterprise Integration Patterns book.
## Background
PyIntegration extends [Pykka](https://www.pykka.org/ "Pykka")  into the enterprise domain where Pykka offers the message-driven model and PyIntegration provides the inversion of control for runtime concerns, such as when certain business logic should execute and where the response should be sent. It supports routing and transformation of messages so that different transports and different data formats can be integrated without impacting testability. In other words, the messaging and integration concerns are handled by the framework, so business components are further isolated from the infrastructure and developers are relieved of complex integration responsibilities.

PyIntegration's design is inspired by the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns as described in the book of the same name by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison Wesley, 2004). Developers who have read that book should be immediately comfortable with the PyIntegration concepts and terminology.
## Goals and Principles
PyIntegration is motivated by the following goals:
*   Provide a simple model for implementing complex enterprise integration solutions.
*   Facilitate asynchronous and message-driven behavior.

PyIntegration is guided by the following principles:
*	Components should be loosely coupled for modularity and testability.
*	The framework should enforce separation of concerns between business logic and integration logic.
*	Extension points should be abstract in nature but within well-defined boundaries to promote reuse and portability.

## Main Components
From the vertical perspective, a layered architecture facilitates separation of concerns, and interface-based contracts between layers promote loose coupling. Message-driven architectures add a horizontal perspective, yet these same goals are still relevant. Just as "layered architecture" is an extremely generic and abstract paradigm, messaging systems typically follow the similarly abstract "pipes-and-filters" model. The "filters" represent any component that is capable of producing and/or consuming messages, and the "pipes" transport the messages between filters so that the components themselves remain loosely-coupled. It is important to note that these two high-level paradigms are not mutually exclusive. The underlying messaging infrastructure that supports the "pipes" should still be encapsulated in a layer whose contracts are defined as interfaces. Likewise, the "filters" themselves would typically be managed within a layer that is logically above the applicationâ€™s service layer, interacting with those services through interfaces much in the same way that a web-tier would.
