    A Message is a generic wrapper for any Python object combined with metadata used by 
    the framework while handling that object. It consists of a payload and headers. For 
    example, when creating a Message from a received File, the file name may be stored in 
    a header to be accessed by downstream components. Likewise, if a Messageâ€™s content is 
    ultimately going to be sent by an outbound Mail adapter, the various properties (to, 
    from, cc, subject, etc.) may be configured as Message header values by an upstream 
    component. Developers can also store any arbitrary key-value pairs in the headers.
